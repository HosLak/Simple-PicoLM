# Simple-PicoLM
Developing more efficient Transformer architectures for language tasks, aiming to drastically reduce model size while preserving high performance.

# About PicoLM
PicoLM is the main project focused on creating a highly efficient, compact language model that rivals the performance of larger models like ChatGPT, Gemini, and Grok, but with significantly reduced size and resource requirements. It incorporates advanced architectural innovations, proprietary optimizations, and comprehensive features tailored for both commercial and high-performance applications. Please note that PicoLM is still under active development and will be made available soon. In the meantime, simple-PicoLM serves as a lightweight, open-source version of PicoLM, sharing foundational code and concepts while omitting certain proprietary elements to protect intellectual property. This allows the community to experiment with and build upon the core ideas without accessing the full, commercial-grade implementation.

## Overview
Simple-PicoLM is an small language model (SLM) project designed to train GPT-like models efficiently and cost-effectively. Its goal is to balance speed and reasoning capabilities while exploring new architectures and optimization techniques. Unlike large and complex models, Simple-PicoLM emphasizes efficiency, simplicity, and low resource consumption, making it well-suited for both specific and general tasks, as well as custom tools or resource-constrained environments.

### Key Difference from the Main PicoLM:
- PicoLM is a more complete and commercial project with advanced features.
- simple-PicoLM is its open-source and non-commercial version, providing the base code to the community, but excluding some key architectural details (such as specific optimizations or advanced modules) to preserve intellectual property rights.

However, simple-PicoLM also performs well in general tasks like everyday chats or content generationâ€”it doesn't fall short!

- **Untied Embedding Weights**: Separate token embedding and output projection for flexibility.
- **Depth-Aware Weight Initialization**: Scales initialization variance by layer depth, applied in reverse due to the PyramidNet MLP structure. See [Unlocking Transformer Learning: Weight Dispersion and a Novel Depth-Aware Initialization Strategy](https://medium.com/@hosseinlack123/unlocking-transformer-learning-weight-dispersion-and-a-novel-depth-aware-initialization-strategy-6e43dddb10a4) for details.
- **Zero-Initialization for Key Layers**: Stabilizes training for attention and MLP outputs.
- **Scaled Embedding Input**: Normalizes token embeddings by sqrt(d_model) for stability.
- **Better LR Scheduler**: Improved learning rate scheduling.
- **Gated Attention (SDPA Output G1)**: Applies a head-specific, elementwise sigmoid gate after Scaled Dot-Product Attention (SDPA) outputs, calculated based on Query (Q).
- **Biases**: Disable all bias terms in feed-forward networks and multi-head self-attention layers, except for the biases in the query, key, and value projections.

## Training
- **Muon Optimizer**: Orthogonalized momentum for efficient gradient updates.
- **Automatic Mixed Precision (AMP)**: Reduces memory usage and speeds up training.
- **Multi-GPU Support**: Enables distributed training for scalability.
- **Dataset**: Uses the [Hosseinlack123/PicoLM-dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/Hosseinlack123/PicoLM-dataset) for training.

Training Results

Using a free Google Colab T4 runtime and only 1 minutes 32 seconds of training, the following result was achieved:

Prompt: ```Once upon a time```

Model Output (trained 1m32s on T4):
```
Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play outside and explore the world around her. One day, she found an old box in her yard. It was so pretty that it looked like a real flower.
Lily opened the box and saw all of different things. "What are you doing?" she asked. Her mom told her about all the toys. So, Lily said she would use the magic wand and put them in the garden. Lily was happy to see her new toy inside.
From then on, Lily loved going to the park every day. She always had lots of fun adventures together and playing with her friends. The end.
```
**Analysis**: The model already produces fluent grammar and some coherent story structure after a very short training run - impressive for 1m32s. However, the output clearly shows hallucination/nonsense (weird facts, repeated/confused phrases). Two main causes are identified:

- **Too little training time**: The short training duration limits the model's ability to learn complex patterns.
- **Too-small dataset**: The limited dataset size restricts the model's exposure to diverse language patterns.

# Model Configuration

The model is currently configured with the following hyperparameters for testing purposes:

- n_layers: 8
- hidden_dim: 256
- n_heads: 8 (head_dim: 32)
- n_kv_heads: 2
- vocab_size: 24,576
- seq_len: 256

**Note**: This is an experimental model designed to test and optimize the architecture's performance on a limited budget. For a deeper dive into the reasoning behind these hyperparameter choices and strategies for building efficient AI models, check out this article: [AI Unlocking Hyperparameter Secrets: Building Better AI Models on a Budget](https://medium.com/@hosseinlack123/aiunlocking-hyperparameter-secrets-building-better-ai-models-on-a-budget-60e25562b5e9)

Once the architecture is finalized, I plan to scale up to the following hyperparameters:

- n_layers: 24
- hidden_dim: 2048
- n_heads: 32 (head_dim: 64)
- n_kv_heads: 8
- vocab_size: Approximately equivalent to GPT-2's vocabulary size
- seq_len: Approximately 2048 (if increasing context length is feasible, otherwise likely to remain around 2048)

# Future Roadmap

**We are actively working on improving the Simple-PicoLM model.** Planned enhancements include:

- **Stepwise Think Fine-Tuning**: The model will be fine-tuned using the Stepwise Think format to enhance reasoning capabilities and achieve faster, high-quality responses.

**Additional plans will be added as the project evolves.**
